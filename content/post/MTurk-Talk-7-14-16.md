Tomorrow I'll be giving an introductory talk/training session on using Amazon's Mechanical Turk for conducting survey based research to a group of new research assistants here at the university of Pennsylvania. I've posted the talk [here](../project/MTurk-Talk-7-14-16.html) (which is still a rough draft as of the time of this posting), and the source is available on [Github](https://github.com/jsperger/MTurkForResearchers). I plan on expanding this is into more detailed How-To guides in the future because I think Amazon's documentation is poor, and while there is good documentation targeted at psychology/social science researchers out there it tends to presume a level of familiarity with Mechanical Turk (e.g. MTurkR's documentation).
